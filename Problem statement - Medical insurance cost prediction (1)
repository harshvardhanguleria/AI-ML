Problem statement-
Build a multivariate Linear regression model to predict the medical insurance cost(charges) based on patient information.
1. Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset
2. Visualize data elements
3. Derive preliminary observations about relationship betwee the variables (independent, dependent)
4. Perform feature engineering
 - Explore possibility of deriving new features 
 - Transform existing features using techniques like Min-max scaling, One hot encoding(dummy variable creation)
5. Perform feature selection using RFE, VIF, iterative Linear regression model summary (p-value of features coefficients)
6. Perform Residual analysis using the training data
7. Build the final regression equation.
